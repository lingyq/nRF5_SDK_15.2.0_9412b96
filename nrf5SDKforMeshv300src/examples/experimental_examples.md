# Experimental examples

Experimental examples and modules that are ready for use, but are using features that are not of production level, have not been submitted for qualification or thoroughly tested,
and their API can change.

The following examples are provided in experimental state:

* @subpage md_examples_experimental_dimming_README "Experimental dimming" demonstrates
  how to use [Generic Level model](@ref GENERIC_LEVEL_MODEL) APIs in an application to implement dimming
  light and corresponding dimmer switch.
* @subpage md_examples_experimental_lpn_README "Experimental Low Power node example" demonstrates the
  Low Power node feature.
* @subpage md_examples_pb_remote_client_README "Remote provisioning client example" demonstrates
  the use of remote provisioning to provision devices outside of the provisioner's radio range.
* @subpage md_examples_pb_remote_server_README "Remote provisioning server example" provides an end-point for relayed provisioning packets when
