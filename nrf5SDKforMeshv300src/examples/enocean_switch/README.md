# EnOcean switch translator client demo

@note This example is not supported by the nRF52810 Series.

## Purpose

This demo project shows how a PTM215B EnOcean switch can be integrated in the mesh eco system.

It demonstrates how to capture the commissioning data of the EnOcean switch and how to translate the
EnOcean switch messages into equivalent mesh messages. It uses two instances of the
[Generic OnOff client model](@ref GENERIC_ONOFF_MODEL).
These On/Off clients can be configured to control desired servers by the provisioner. Following
diagram shows the illustration of such hybrid network containing non-Bluetooth Mesh device, translator client,
and servers. All servers have relay functionality enabled thereby allowing EnOcean switch to control state of any
of the servers in the network.

To see the demonstration, this example has to be used with a Provisioner and one or more Servers
from the [light_switch](@ref md_examples_light_switch_README) examples folder.


## Getting started

### Hardware requirements

See [Compatibility](@ref md_doc_introduction_mesh_compatibility) for information about the supported boards.

- One development board for this example.
- One development board for the provisioner or @link_nrf_mesh_app (@link_nrf_mesh_app_ios or @link_nrf_mesh_app_android).
- One or more development boards for the servers.
  If you have more than thirty boards for the server, set `SERVER_NODE_COUNT` (in `light_switch_example_common.h`)
  to the number of boards available and rebuild the provisioner example.

### Running the demo

To build the example, follow the instructions in
[Building the Mesh Stack](@ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_build). For commands required to program a device using `nrfjprog`,
see the [Running examples using nrfjprog](@ref how_to_run_examples_nrfjprog) section on the @ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_run_examples page.

To run the examples, the boards must be provisioned first. It can be done using either
[the development board](@ref enocean_switch_prov_prov_example) or
[nRF Mesh mobile app](@ref enocean_switch_prov_nrf_mesh).

#### Provisioning using the development board @anchor enocean_switch_prov_prov_example

To complete the provisioning process:

1. Erase the device flash of your development boards and program the SoftDevice on each board.
2. Flash the provisioner firmware on one board, this example on another board,
and the server firmware on other board or boards.
3. Connect RTT viewer to view the RTT output generated by the translator client and the provisioner.
4. Press Button 1 on the provisioner to start the provisioning process.

The provisioner prints details about the provisioning and the configuration process in the RTT log.
When provisioner is scanning and provisioning a device, LED 1 on the Provisioner board is turned ON.
When configuration procedure is underway, LED 2 on the provisioner board is turned ON.

The provisioner configures the On/Off client model instances on the client board to control various
servers as follows:
- The Button A0 turns ON LED 1 on the servers with Odd addresses.
- The Button A1 turns OFF LED 1 on the servers with Odd addresses.
- The Button B0 turns ON LED 1 on the servers with Even addresses.
- The Button B1 turns OFF LED 1 on the servers with Even addresses.

If provisioner encounters an error during the provisioning or configuration process for a certain node,
you can reset the provisioner to restart this process for that node.

Any unhandled error is indicated by turning on all the LEDs on the board in steady state. You will need
to reset the board to restart the application.

#### Provisioning with nRF Mesh app @anchor enocean_switch_prov_nrf_mesh

To provision using the mobile app, both on iOS and Android:

1. Erase the device flash of your development boards and program the SoftDevice.
2. Flash this example on one board and the server firmware on other boards.
3. Download @link_nrf_mesh_app (@link_nrf_mesh_app_ios or @link_nrf_mesh_app_android).
4. Provision the nodes. The client board is `nRF5x Mesh Enocean Translator`,
the server board is `nRF5x Mesh Light`.
5. Bind the Generic Level client and server model instances on the nodes with the same app key.
6. Set the publish address of the first Generic Level client model instance on the client example to
the unicast address of any server node.
7. Use buttons on the Enocean Switch to toggle the LED state on the associated server.

#### Capturing the commissioning data of the EnOcean switch

@note These steps can be done either before or after the translator client
has been provisioned.

To capture the commissioning data of the EnOcean switch, put the EnOcean switch in
the radio-based commissioning mode by pressing the special button sequence:

To enter commissioning mode:

1. Make sure that the Disable Radio Commissioning flag in the Configuration register of the NFC interface is set to 0b0 (default state).
2. Start by selecting one button contact of PTM 215B. Any button of
PTM 215B (A0, A1, B0, B1) can be used. This button is referred to as Button_X in Figure 20 above.
3. Execute the following sequence:
	1. Press and hold the selected button for more than 7 seconds before releasing it.
	2. Press the selected button quickly (hold for less than 2 seconds).
	3. Press and hold the selected button again for more than 7 seconds before releasing it.

Upon detection of this sequence, PTM 215B enters the commissioning mode. See @link_enocean_ds for reference.

Once entered in the radio commissioning mode, PTM215B transmits the commissioning telegrams. These
telegrams will be captured by the translator, and the security material contained within those
telegrams will be stored in the flash.

Once one of the commissioning telegrams is captured by the translator, 4 LEDs will blink 4 times.

@note
The example supports two Enocean switches to be connected in parallel. You can repeat the above
mentioned steps to commission the second switch.

#### Testing

Once the provisioning and the configuration of the EnOcean translator client node and at least one of
the server nodes are completed and the commissioning data is captured, you can press buttons
on the EnOcean switch to toggle the LED state on the associated servers.

If any of the devices is powered off and back on, it will remember its configuration
in flash, and will rejoin the network. More information about the flash manager can be found
in the [flash manager documentation](@ref md_doc_libraries_flash_manager).

## Details

For details about the provisioning and configuration process, see the
[Exploring Mesh APIs](@ref md_doc_getting_started_how_to_build_your_network) guide.
See [Light switch demo README](@ref md_examples_light_switch_README) to get more information
about the provisioner and server examples.

### EnOcean switch translator client

The *EnOcean switch translator client* has a provisionee role in the network.
The client receives messages from the PTM215B switch and converts them to
equivalent On/Off client messages to control the state of LED 1 on servers.
It instantiates two instances of the Generic OnOff Client model and can either
be provisioned and configured by the provisioner device or by a GATT-based
provisioner. The provisioner configures these client model instances to
communicate with servers.

The example is configured to store security material for two EnOcean switch. If you want to reset
the application data without re-flashing the firmware, press Button 4. LED 1 will blink twice to
indicate that application specific data and mesh related data has been erased. Press Reset button
to reset the board and start the application.

If you want this example to support more than two EnOcean switches in parallel, set the value
of `MAX_ENOCEAN_DEVICES_SUPPORTED` to the desired number of switches.
