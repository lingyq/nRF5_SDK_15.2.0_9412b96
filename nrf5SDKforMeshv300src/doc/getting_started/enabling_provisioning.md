# Enabling provisioning

Provisioning is the process of providing new devices in the mesh network with the information they need to join
a network. 

The nRF5 SDK for Mesh offers two provisioning modes:
- Standard provisioning, described in @subpage md_doc_getting_started_provisioning
- Optional provisioning over GATT, described in @subpage md_doc_getting_started_gatt_proxy
